This repository is following along with the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.
I have experience in Python, but I have not used it in several years. I will be completing each project of the course, in order to ensure I understand even the basic concepts.
I welcome any feedback to programs I create, as I am eager to relearn this wonderful language.
