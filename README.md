This repository is dedicated to the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.
I have experience in Python, but I have not used it in several years. I will be completing each project of the course, in order to ensure I understand even the basic concepts.
I do not expect to remain strict in completing a project each day, but my goal will be to complete the course in 20 weeks (1 project a day, Monday-Friday).
