'''
The purpose of this project was to improve upon the previous day's project. The improvements included creating a Google form
for new users to fill out, which was linked to an additional sheet in the the Google Sheet workbook. This sheet includes the
users name and email address. The python program would then search for flights, as it did yesterday, but it would then send an
email to each user who signed up for the service. Additional improvements were searching for direct flights first, and if none
were found, then searching for flights with stops.
