/*
The purpose of this project was to gain more experience with CSS. I learned how to apply text color, background color,
font properties such as font-family and font size (including px, pt, em, and rem), and how to use <div> to create boxes,
how to use and apply margin, borders, and padding. I also worked to get comfortable using tags and classes.
