The purpose of this project is to gain experience with opening, editing, and creating
files using Python. I also gained experience using the "with ... as" statement.
I also received more practice modifying strings, such as the "splitlines" and "replace"
functions. Lastly, the Udemy course taught relative and absolute file paths, which I
already had experience with as a system and network adminstrator.
